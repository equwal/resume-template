# Resume Template

## Instructions

1. Make your own branch `git branch your-name`.
2. Edit `author.tex` and `resume.tex` for content.
3. Edit `formatting.tex` to change the format.
4. `pdflatex resume.tex` to compile.

## Contributing
Please be careful to only pull request changes to the `formatting.tex` file,
since the other files are meant to be user-edited files.
